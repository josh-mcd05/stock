In terms of design, my partner and I extracted the data from the API Alpha Vantage as an array. 
From there, we created multiple classes, representing a stock on certain day, the stock in general, and a portfolio.
This was the model of our program and we wrote the methods for x-day average, x-day crossover, value of portfolio, and difference in stock for a start and end day.
Then, we wrote the controller which was similar to lab 7, where a menu was outputted, and also used the menu idea with multiple different cases and even cases inside of a case.
The controller adjusted the model based on the command.
Finally, the view was written to work with the controller and displayed the text interface a user could interact with.
